    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This step is about setting up the requirments needed to make the software. It invloves collecting all the information needed to make the software. "
const design = "This step is about how you want the layout to work. Like how the user will interact with your software"
const implementation = "This step is about actaully implementing what you had been planning and amalyzing, and writting the code for the steps above."
const testingAndIntergration = " This is about making sure your code fits all the requirments, making sure the software is ready for its audience"
const maintain = `Once you "finish" you are never really finished. It is important to maintain the software to upkeep with the amount of users joining, fixing bugs that arise etc.`
